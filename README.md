My dreadful little dotfiles repo

## do i care about this?

probably not, yo, it's just me using github for sync between machines

my nvim config is maybe vaguely interesting from a 'this feels mostly like raw vim' POV.
everyone seems to want vim to be an IDE, ~i just want good IDE tools hiding behind my 
regular ol' vimisms.~ i have gone to the dark side, pray for me
